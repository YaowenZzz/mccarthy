# stokes/project11/

The glacier in this directory has different geometry from that generated by `stokes/domain.py`.  Here it is a glacier margin.  Specifically, the script `profile.py` generates a surface elevation from a power-law parameterization of the surface:

`x(t) = L (1 - t^2/3), y(t) = H0 t`

for `0 <= t <= 1`.  The bed elevation is zero.

Like `stokes/domain.py`, the script `profile.py` creates a geometry-description (`.geo`) file suitable for Gmsh.  The surface nodes in this mesh are equally-spaced in arclength, though that feature is probably not crucial.

### Usage

        $ ./profile.py -o margin.geo
        $ gmsh -2 margin.geo

This generates a 2D mesh in `margin.msh` with the default mesh featur size of 80 m.  You can view it in Gmsh (`gmsh margin.msh`).

Next, make sure you have activated the Firedrake venv as described in `stokes/README.md`.

Now do a run like the following.  Note we set the direction of gravity to be vertical; vector gravity is `alpha`=0 degrees off vertical:

        (firedrake) $ ../flow.py -mesh margin.msh -alpha 0.0

Note that one can generate a higher-resolution mesh with

        $ ./profile.py -hmesh 40.0 -o margin.geo
