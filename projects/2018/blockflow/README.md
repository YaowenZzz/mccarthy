FIXME
=========================

reassurance
-----------

The point of the project is not to get you to a particular spot!  The point is to _help you learn fast from whereever you currently are_.

So please be honest with yourself about what you don't know, and please ask about that!  Another student may program better than you, or have seen more differential equations, or have more glaciers background, or whatever.  This is irrelevant to my goal, which is to help you move forward as far as possible in one intense week.

Though I intend to help you go forward in the direction of this project and topic, it must be from the things _you_ do understand into things _you_ do not understand.
