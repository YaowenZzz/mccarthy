FIXME
=========================

reassurance
-----------

The point of the project is not to reach a particular destination!  The point is to _help you learn fast from whereever you currently are_.  So please be honest with yourself about what you don't know, and please ask about it.  Another student may know more programming than you, or have seen more differential equations, or have more glaciers background, or whatever.  This is irrelevant to my goal, which is to help you move forward as far as possible in one intense week.  Forward progress must be from the things _you_ do understand into things _you_ do not understand.
