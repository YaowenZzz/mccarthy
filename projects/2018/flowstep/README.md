Glacier flow over a step
========================

The point of the project is not to reach a particular destination!  The point is to _help you learn fast from whereever you currently are_.  So please be honest with yourself about what you don't know, and ask about it.  Another student may know more programming than you, or have seen more differential equations, or have more glaciers background, or whatever.  But things like that are irrelevant to my goal, which is to help you move forward as far as possible in one intense week.  Forward progress must be from the things _you_ understand into things _you_ do not understand.

PROJECT 4: Glacier flow over a step

ADVISOR: Ed Bueler

DESCRIPTION: How does a glacier flow over a submerged cliff or a step in the bedrock?  Such a geometry can be put into in a complete (Stokes) flow model, and we will work with one of those.  On the other hand, the shallow models used for large-scale ice sheet studies must also produce reasonable results for bedrock configurations including steep cliffs and steps.  This project will work back and forth with the equations and numerical models, aiming to build an understanding of the flow and glacial profiles associated to such bad bed topography.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS: Numerical Python (Python3+numpy+matplotlib).  The Firedrake finite element Python library will be used, but it will be installed on a provided laptop.

REQUIRED STUDENT BACKGROUND: Exposure to differential equations and linear algebra.  Basic programming with numerical Python.
