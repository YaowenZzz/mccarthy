Ice shelves: sidewall stresses and universal profiles
=====================================================

reassurance
-----------

The point of the project is not to get you to a particular spot!  The point is to _help you learn fast from whereever you currently are_.

So please be honest with yourself about what you don't know, and please ask about that!  Another student may program better than you, or have seen more differential equations, or have more glaciers background, or whatever.  This is irrelevant to my goal, which is to help you move forward as far as possible in one intense week.

Though I intend to help you go forward in the direction of this project and topic, it must be from the things _you_ do understand into things _you_ do not understand.

PROJECT XX: Ice shelves: sidewall stresses and universal profiles

ADVISOR: Ed Bueler

DESCRIPTION: FIXME

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS: Matlab/Octave or Python (with numpy and matplotlib).

REQUIRED STUDENT BACKGROUND: Exposure to differential equations and linear algebra, and 


references and reading
----------------------

First, see the notes (`notes/notes.pdf`).  Pay special attention to section 9 about the SSA model of ice shelves.  This project will directly extend that material.

The following papers are available on paper and in the current directory:

    * S. Pegler, 2016.  _The dynamics of confined extensional flows_, J. Fluid Mech. 804, 24--57.

    * S. Pegler and G. Worster, 2012.  _Dynamics of a viscous layer flowing radially over an inviscid ocean_, J. Fluid Mech. 696, 152--174.

The first of these papers is the one we will follow closely, but the second is useful comparison/background.
