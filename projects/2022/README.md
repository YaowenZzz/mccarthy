# projects/2022/

These are notes and data and codes for my two suggested projects for the McCarthy International Summer School in Glaciology in 2022.  See the `README.md` in the subdirectories `kinematic/` and `glacierbumps/` for documentation.  Note that the numbers "Project 10" and "Project 11" match the [projects list](https://glaciers.gi.alaska.edu/content/student-projects-0) for the Summer School.
