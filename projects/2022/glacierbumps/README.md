# Stokes modeling of glacier velocity: the effects of surface bumps

## reassurance

The point of the project is not to reach a particular destination!  It is to _help you learn fast from wherever you currently are_.  So please be honest with yourself about what you don't know, and please do ask about it!  Another student may know more programming than you, or have seen more differential equations, or have more glaciers background, or data-manipulation skills, or whatever.  That is irrelevant to my goal.  I just want to help you move forward as far as possible in one intense week.  Forward progress must be from things _you_ do understand into things _you_ do not yet understand!

## description

PROJECT 7: Stokes modeling of glacier velocity: the effects of surface bumps

ADVISOR: Ed Bueler

DESCRIPTION: How does the velocity field of a glacier change if you put a pile of ice somewhere on its surface, or if you dig a pit somewhere?  The change in the velocity field reveals the boundary Green's functions of the Stokes problem for glaciers.  The goal of this project is to build new understanding of these Green's functions.  How do they depend on glacier thickness or sliding?  How do they depend on nearness to margins or bed topography?  How can they be exploited to build faster numerical models?  Students will use a modern finite-element framework for solving the Glen-Stokes equations, in a flowline plane, for student-chosen glacier geometries, as we explore.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS: Python/numpy, _running locally on your machine_.  Ideally, functional Firedrake, Gmsh, and Paraview installations.  (But I'll bring an extra laptop, pre-loaded.)

REQUIRED STUDENT BACKGROUND: Exposure to linear algebra, numerical methods, partial differential equations, and (ideally) the finite element method.
