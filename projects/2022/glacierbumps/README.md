# Bumps on glaciers reveal the meaning of the Stokes equations


## reassurance

The point of the project is not to reach a particular destination!  It is to _help you learn fast from wherever you currently are_.  So please be honest with yourself about what you don't know, and please do ask about it!  Another student may know more programming than you, or have seen more differential equations, or have more glaciers background, or data-manipulation skills, or whatever.  That is irrelevant to my goal.  I just want to help you move forward as far as possible in one intense week.  Forward progress must be from things _you_ do understand into things _you_ do not yet understand!


## description

PROJECT Y: Bumps on glaciers reveal the meaning of the Stokes equations

ADVISOR: Ed Bueler

DESCRIPTION: How does the velocity field of a glacier change if you put a pile of ice somewhere on its surface, or if you dig a pit somewhere?  What if you keep the surface the same but replace the surface ice at some location with something heavier or lighter?  By subtraction, the new velocity fields reveal the boundary Green's function of the Stokes problem for glaciers.  The goal of this project is to build a picture book of these Green's functions, something glaciologists need even if they don't know it.  (These Green's functions may also be the key to faster numerical glacier models.)  Along the way you'll become familiar with a modern finite-element framework for solving the Glen-Stokes equations in a flowline plane.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS: Python/numpy, _running locally on your machine_.  Ideally, functional Firedrake, Gmsh, and Paraview installations, but I'll bring an extra laptop with these.

REQUIRED STUDENT BACKGROUND: Exposure to linear algebra, partial differential equations, and (ideally) the finite element method.
